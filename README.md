gwen-web [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web)
========

Gwen-web is a web automation engine that runs inside the 
[gwen](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen) interpreter. 
It allows teams to automate front end web tests by writing 
specifications instead of code. It also provides 
users with the ability to interactively debug tests before 
committing them to an automation cycle.  
 
Once the tests have been written, gwen-web is able to run them 
sequentially or in parallel.  It can also target different types
of browsers including Firefox, Chrome, IE and Safari.

Reports showing the status of each test execution, including timings, 
screenshots, slideshows, and captured runtime data can also be generated.
