- Introduce behavior rules setting to enforce good Gherkin style
  - `gwen.behavior.rules=strict|lenient`
    - `strict`: The following rules are enforced in feature files with violations reported as errors:

      - *Given* steps must set context
      - *When* steps must perform actions
      - *Then* steps must perform assertions
      - *But* steps must perform assertions (and are permitted after *Then* steps)
      - StepDefs tagged with:
        - `@Context` : can only be called by *Givens*
        - `@Action` : can only be called by *Whens*
        - `@Assertion` : can only be called by *Thens* or *Buts*
    - `lenient`: no rules are enforced
    - Default is `lenient` for backwards compatiblity but plan is to change it 
      to `strict` in upcoming major (v3.0.0) release

  - Add assocative meta setting:
    - `gwen.associative.meta=true|false` (default is false)
    - If enabled, then if a meta file has the same name (excluding file extension) and is 
      in the same location as a feature, then load that meta last for that feature only and skip over 
      all other meta in the path to the feature that is assocaited in same way to any other features. 
      This enables users to define meta that is bound to one feature only by defininig it in a meta 
      file in the same location as the feature and naming it with the same name as the feature but 
      with the .meta extension instead (handy for cases where a meta per feature is desirable).
    - This setting is only honoured if `gwen.auto.discover.meta` is enabled (which it is by default).

  - `feature`: to give each feature a state that is shared across scenarios (default)
  - `scenario`: to give each scenario a new state that is not shared across scenarios
- The `--parallel` option now runs:
  - features in parallel when configured state level is `feature`
  - scenarios in parallel when the configured state level is `scenario`
- Added `--parallel-features` command line option to force parallel feature execution
  regardless of state level
- Input CSV data records are now resolved to Backgrounds instead of top level Scenarios
  to support both feature and scenario level states

    expired. The timeout period defined by either:
    - the locator level wait/timeout assigned to an element (overridden locator level timeout)
    - the global locator wait/timeout setting: `gwen.web.locator.wait.seconds` (configured locator timeout)
    - the global wait/timeout setting: `gwen.web.wait.seconds` (configured global timeout)
    - or 10 seconds (default global timeout)

    ```
    - Where
      - column 1 = id|name|tag name|css selector|xpath|class name|link text|partial link text|javascript
      - column 2 = the lookup expression literal
- Add `gwen.web.implicit.js.locators` setting to enable Gwen to implicitly convert all locator bindings to JavaScript
  equivalents and force all elements to be located by executing javascript on the page instead of looking them up
  using web driver locators. Enabling this is useful when dealing with web sites that dynamically render or change
  the visibility of elements on pages or manipulate the DOM. Value values are:
  - `false` to disable (default)
  - `false` to enable

- Add DSL for registering javascript actions on web elements (to assist with cross browser actions 
  where standard web driver instructions do not produce expected results).

    standard web driver click)
  - Retry "wait until" operations when browser is not ready to execute javascript predicates
- Dry run fix
  - check that the condition and element attributes are bound in calls to DSL:

=====
May 24, 2016, 7.24 PM GMT+10 (AEST)
- Updated Gwen from v1.2.0 to v[1.2.1](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen/releases/tag/v1.2.1)
  To pick up the following:
  - Fixed tag filtering to accept tagged features and scenarios that have at 
    least one specified include tag and exclude all specified exclude tags. 
    The specified include and exclude tags are now partitioned and evaluated 
    separately (as per above) instead of being logically ANDed together from 
    left to right. Fixed #24
  - Only dump environment on failure when in batch mode

1.4.0
=====
Apr 12 2016, 10:55 PM GMT+10 (AEST)
- Add support for accepting and dismissing browser popup boxes (PR #21). New DSL includes:
  - I <accept|dismiss> the <alert|confirmation> popup
- Add ability to switch between parent and child windows (PR #22). New DSL includes:
  - I switch to the child window
  - I close the child window
  - I switch to the parent window
- Avoid contiguous duplicate screenshots (PR #23)
  - Solution was to discard the current screenshot if its size in bytes matches that 
    of the last captured screenshot.
  - This feature is now on by default. It can be turned off by setting: 
      gwen.web.capture.screenshots.duplicates=true
- Added support for JSON path matching using library: https://github.com/jayway/JsonPath
  - New DSL includes:
    - the page title <should|should not> match json path "<expression>"
    - the page title <should|should not> match json path <attribute>
    - <element|attribute> <should|should not> match json path "<expression>"
    - <dropdown> <text|value> <should|should not> match json path "<expression>"
    - <dropdown> <text|value> <should|should not> match json path <attribute>
    - I capture the content in <element|attribute|property> by json path "<expression>" as <attribute>
    - <attribute> <is|will be> defined in <source> by json path "<expression>"
- Updated Gwen from v1.1.1 to v[1.2.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen/releases/tag/v1.1.2)
  - To pick up sequence counter number fix for all attachment filenames
- Update bundled selenium webdriver from v2.51.0 to v2.53.0

1.3.1
=====
Mar 6, 2016, 10:21 PM GMT+11 (AEDT)
- Updated Gwen from v1.1.0 to v[1.1.1](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen/releases/tag/v1.1.1)
  - To pick up exit code changes
- Added convenience launch scripts in root directory of distributed package
  (so users can invoke gwen directly from the install directory)

1.3.0
=====
Feb 29, 2016, 9:18 PM GMT+11 (AEDT)
- Updated Gwen from v1.0.3 to v[1.1.0](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen/releases/tag/v1.1.0)
  - Added support for configuring a ramp up interval (in seconds) for 
    staggered parallel execution ~ for user request issue gwen-interpreter/gwen#18. 
    The interval can be set through the `gwen.rampup.interval.seconds` setting
    This setting is only applicable for parallel execution mode. If it is 
    not set or is set to zero, then no staggering will occur (as per default 
    behavior). 
  - Added new `gwen.report.suppress.meta` setting for controlling whether or 
    not meta reports should be generated with HTML reports (default value is 
    false). If you have a lot of meta, suppressing the meta reports can 
    save a lot of disk space. Enabling this setting does not suppress the 
    hyperlinked stepdefs in feature reports (they will always be rendered).
- Added the following alternative DSL for closing the current browser session
  - I close the current browser

1.2.1
=====
Feb 29, 2016, 6:37 PM GMT+11 (AEDT)
- Fixed issue #20 - Cannot perform actions on elements bound to names containing 'of' literal 
  - Solution was to perform the `I <click|check|uncheck> <element>` logic if 
    `I  <click|check|uncheck> <element> of <context>` results in a LocatorBindingException
- Immediately return from a 'should not' assertion step if it evaluates to true (instead of 
  waiting until timeout)

1.2.0
=====
Feb 23, 2016, 09:57 PM GMT+11 (AEDT)
- Added the following DSLs for managing browser sessions (pull request #19):
  - I start a new browser
  - I close the current browser
  - I start a browser for <session>
  - I close the browser for <session>
  - I switch to <session>
- Added DSL for performing actions on context sensitive elements (pull request #18):
  - I <click|check|uncheck> <element> of <context>

1.1.1
=====
Feb 16, 2016, 12:43 PM GMT+11 (AEDT)
- Fixed #17 - Do nothing when checking/unchecking checkboxes or radio 
  buttons that are already checked or unchecked respectively 
  - Solution was to move the guards from the check and uncheck 
    pattern match clauses to their bodies instead

1.1.0
=====
Feb 11, 2016, 11:47 PM GMT+11 (AEDT)
- Added support for chaining locators through new DSL:
  - <element> can be located by <locator> "<expression>" in <container>
  - Where <container> can be 
    - An element
      - In this case <element> is located within the <container> element
    - A frame
      - In this case <element> is located within the page in the <container> 
        frame  
      - The WebEnvContext.withElement function will restore the previous window 
        in the web driver if the location of the element within the frame 
        fails on the first attempt. 
  - All element lookups and operations now occur inside the
    WebEnvContext.withElement function. This is where all 1st and 2nd lookup 
    attempts occur and where switching to the previous window is performed 
    when operations on elements are completed. The web engine no longer 
    calls the locator methods directly (it now calls withElement instead).
- Simplified assertion error messages
- Update selenium webdriver from v2.48.1 to v2.51.0
- Update Gwen from v1.0.1 to v[1.0.3](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen/releases/tag/v1.0.3)

1.0.2
=====
Jan 29, 2016, 5:13 PM GMT+11 (AEDT)
- Fixed problem with 1.0.1 release which had a snapshot dependency to Gwen
  in the maven POM file.
