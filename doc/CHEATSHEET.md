Configuration Settings
----------------------

The following settings can be used to configure certain runtime aspects. These can be defined in 
your local `gwen.properties` file (located in your user home directory) or in a separate properties 
file provided through the `-p|--properties` command line option.

| Property/Setting                            | Default value  | Supported Values | Description |

### Web driver settings

In addition to the above settings, all selenium web driver system properties are also supported. For example, 
all the [FireFox driver properties](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/FirefoxDriver#Important_System_Properties) are supported. 

### Native Web Drivers

If you use Chrome or IE, then you will need to download the 
[chrome web driver](http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html) 
or [IE web driver server](http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html) 
respectively and install it on your system path. If you do not have permission to 
install the driver on your system path, then you can set the path to your 
downloaded driver location in your _gwen.properties_ file as shown below:
  
```
    (chrome)  webdriver.chrome.driver = /path/to/chromedriver
    (ie)      webdriver.ie.driver = c:/path/to/IEDriverServer.exe
```

If you want to use Safari, then you will need to install the latest  
[safari driver extension](http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html) 
in your browser.

### Logging settings

All log4j system properties are also supported. The following logging 
configuration is used by default if no `log4j.configuration` setting 
is specified. For more information about log4j, 
see [the log4j FAQ](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/faq.html).

```
# Set root logger level to INFO and append to STDOUT
log4j.rootLogger=INFO, STDOUT

# STDOUT is set to be a ConsoleAppender.
log4j.appender.STDOUT=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender

# STDOUT uses PatternLayout.
log4j.appender.STDOUT.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.STDOUT.layout.ConversionPattern=%p - %m%n

# Gwen logging level
log4j.logger.gwen=INFO
```
