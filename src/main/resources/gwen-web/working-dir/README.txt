Gwen Working Directory
======================

This is the Gwen working directory for your project where you can launch and manage 
all your Gherkin features, Gwen meta and settings files.

Default structure:

  gwen                 : Top level Gwen working directory
  | gwen.properties    : Common Gwen settings file
  | .gitignore         : Git ignore file
  + /browsers          : Browser settings folder
  + /env               : Environment settings folder
  + /features          : Features/meta folder
