Gwen workspace

features directory
------------------

Add all your gherkin feature files here. You can create subdirectories here
to manage your feature files in whichever way you wish.

But where do I put my meta files?

If you find yourself asking this question, then you should do some MANDATORY reading 
about the various Meta strategies that Gwen supports here:
