Environments
============

Configure all your environment settings here (one file per environment).

To load settings for an environment, pass the associated environment config file to the Gwen - `-c/--config` CLI option.

For example, to use dev environment:
- `-c gwen/env/dev.conf`
- or `--config gwen/env/dev.conf`
