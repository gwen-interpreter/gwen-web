# Meta features are the automation glue in Gwen and they are defined 
# in Gherkin too. They define locators and step definitions that are 
# matched against steps in features to find elements and perform 
# browser operations. They are loaded into memory before feature 
# execution commences.
 
# @StepDef annotated Scenarios are step definitions in Gwen. The
# name of the Scenario becomes the name of the step def. Steps
# in features that match this name are executed by Gwen by 
# evaluating the sequence of steps defined in that step def.

@Sample
Feature: Google search meta

  @StepDef
  @Context
  Scenario: I have Google in my browser
          
    Gwen will match the name of this step def to the first step
    in the feature above and evaluate the steps that follow. These
    steps are matched against predefined steps in the Gwen Web DSL
    to perform browser operations for you at runtime.

    Given I start a new browser
     When I navigate to "http://www.google.com"
     Then the page title should be "Google"

  @StepDef
  @Action
  Scenario: I do a search for "<query>"

    Gwen will match the name of this step def to the second
    step in the feature above and assign the <query> parameter to the
    value provided at the matching location. Gwen will then evaluate the
    steps below and resolve any $<query> references to that value.

    Given the search field can be located by name "q"
     When I enter "$<query>" in the search field
     Then the page title should contain "$<query>"

  @StepDef
  @Assertion
  Scenario: I should find a Gwen page

    Gwen will match the name of this step def to the last
    step in the feature above and evaluate the steps that follow.

    Given link 1 can be located by css selector ".g a"
     When I click link 1
     Then the current URL should match regex ".+[G|g]wen.*"
