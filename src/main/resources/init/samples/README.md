Gwen Samples
============

This directory contains some sample Gwen features to help you get started (delete or keep them, it's up to you).

To run all the provided samples on the default browser (chrome), run the follwing in your project root:
- `./gwen -b samples`
  - Note: the `-b` switch instructs Gwen to exit once done (otherwise REPL mode opens)

> If you don't want chrome to be the default browser, you can change it by updating the `gwen.web.browser.target` setting in the `gwen.conf` file in your project root.
