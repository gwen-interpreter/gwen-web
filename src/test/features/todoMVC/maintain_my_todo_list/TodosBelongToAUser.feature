   Feature: Todos belong to a user
  
Background: Open two browser sessions for two users
      Given I have no open browser
       When I start a browser for James
        And I start a browser for Jane
       Then I should have 2 open browsers
        
  Scenario: I should not affect todos belonging to another user 
      Given I have an open browser
       When I switch to James
        And I browse to the application home page
        And I add a "Walk the dog" item
        And I add a "Put out the garbage" item
        And I switch to Jane
        And I browse to the application home page
        And I add a "Walk the dog" item
        And I add a "Walk the cat" item
        And I switch to James
        And I complete the "Walk the dog" item
        And I switch to Jane
       Then the displayed items should be "Walk the dog,Walk the cat"
