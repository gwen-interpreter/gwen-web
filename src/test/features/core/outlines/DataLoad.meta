  Scenario Outline: JSON examples should load
    Given the website is "<website>"
      And match is defined by js "'${website}' == '<website>'"
     When I capture the text in the website by regex "(.+?):.*" as the protocol
     Then the protocol should be "https"
      And the secret should not be blank
      And website should not be blank
      And website should be "<website>"
      And match should be true
