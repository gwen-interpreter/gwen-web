Feature: Join Strings Meta

  @StepDef
  @Action
  Scenario: I join the two strings
    Given the result is "${string 1}${string 2}"

  @StepDef
  @Action
  Scenario Outline: I join two strings in meta

    This scenario is loaded into memory and evaluated whenever
    the outline is referenced by a step in a feature

    Given string 1 is "<string 1>"
      And string 2 is "<string 2>"
     When I join the two strings
     Then the result should be "<result>"

    Examples:

      The header row contains the placeholder names. The body rows that
      follow contain the data that is bound to each scenario that is evaluated.

        | string 1 | string 2 | result   |
        | howdy    | doo      | howdydoo |
        | any      | thing    | anything |
