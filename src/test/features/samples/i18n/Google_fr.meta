 # Meta features are the automation glue in Gwen and they are defined 
 # in Gherkin too. They define locators and step definitions that are 
 # matched against steps in features to find elements and perform 
 # browser operations. They are loaded into memory before feature 
 # execution commences.
 
 # @StepDef annotated Scenarios are step definitions in Gwen. The
 # name of the Scenario becomes the name of the step def. Steps
 # in features that match this name are executed by Gwen by 
 # evaluating the sequence of steps defined in that step def.
