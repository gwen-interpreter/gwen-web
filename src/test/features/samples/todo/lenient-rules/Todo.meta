Feature: Todo meta
 
@StepDef
Scenario: I should be on the todo page
    Given the heading can be located by tag name "h1"
     Then the heading should be "todos"
      And the todo field can be located by class name "new-todo"
      And the active item count can be located by css selector ".todo-count > strong"
 
@StepDef
Scenario: I add a "<todo>" item
     When I enter "$<todo>" in the todo field
     Then the "$<todo>" item can be located by xpath
          """
          //label[contains(.,'$<todo>')]/preceding-sibling::input
          """
      And the "$<todo>" item should not be ticked
