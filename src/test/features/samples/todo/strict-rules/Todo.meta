Feature: Todo meta

  @StepDef
  @Context
  Scenario: a new todo list
      Given the heading can be located by tag name "h1"
       When I navigate to "http://todomvc.com/examples/angularjs"
       Then the heading should be "todos"
        And the todo field can be located by class name "new-todo"
        And the active item count can be located by css selector ".todo-count > strong"

  @StepDef
  @Action
  @DataTable(header="top")
  Scenario: the following items are added
        And I add a todo item for each data record

  @StepDef
  Scenario: I add a todo item
      Given the todo item is "${data[ITEM]}"
       When I enter the todo item in the todo field
       Then the added item can be located by xpath
             """
             //label[contains(.,'${the todo item}')]/preceding-sibling::input
             """
        And the added item should be unticked
        And the active item count should be "${record.number}"

  @StepDef
  @Action
  Scenario: all items are completed
       When I tick item for each item located by class name "toggle"

  @StepDef
  @Assertion
  Scenario: no active items should remain
       Then the active item count should be "0"
