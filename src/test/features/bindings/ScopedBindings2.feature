 Feature: Scoped binding tests with background initializer
      
Background: Init attributes
    Given a is "1"
      And b is defined by javascript "1"
      And c is "1"
      And d is defined by javascript "${c}"
      And e is "1"
     Then a should be "1"
      And b should be "1"
      And c should be "1"
      And d should be "1"
      And e should be "1" 
      
Scenario: System properties should resolve
    Given my java version is "${java.version}"
     Then my java version should not contain "java.version"
	
Scenario: Global binding defined in local scope should override that in feature scope
    Given I am on the A page
     Then a is "2"
      And a should be "2"
      
Scenario: Global binding defined in local scope should override javascript binding in feature scope
     When I am on the B page
     Then b is "2"
      And b should be "2"
      
Scenario: Binding of different type in local scope should override global of same name
     When I am on the CD page
     Then c is defined by javascript "2"
      And d is defined by javascript "${c}1"
      And c should be "2"
      And d should be "21"
      
Scenario: Capture of dynamic attribute into static attribute should be visible in current scope 
    Given I am on the E page
     Then e should be "1" 
     When e is defined by javascript "2+1"
      And I capture the text in e by regex "(\d)" as e
      And ee is "${e}"
     Then ee should be "3"
     When e is "2"
     Then e should be "2"
     When e is defined by javascript "2+2"
     Then e should be "4"
