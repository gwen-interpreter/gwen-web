 Feature: TodoMVC meta
  
@StepDef
Scenario: I launch the Todo app
    Given I resize the window to width 800 and height 800
     When I navigate to "http://todomvc.com/examples/angularjs"
     Then the number of active items can be located by css selector ".todo-count > strong"

@StepDef
Scenario: I add a "<todo>" item
    Given the new item field can be located by class name "new-todo"
     When I enter "$<todo>" in the new item field
     Then the "$<todo>" item can be located by xpath "//label[contains(.,'$<todo>')]/preceding-sibling::input"
      And the "$<todo>" item should not be ticked
