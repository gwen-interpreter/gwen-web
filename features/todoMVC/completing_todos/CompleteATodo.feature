   Feature: Complete a Todo
  
Background: Open a new browser
      Given I have no open browser
       When I start a browser for James
       Then I should have 1 open browser
      
  Scenario: I should be able to complete a todo
      Given I have an open browser
       When I browse to the application home page
        And I add a "Walk the dog" item
        And I add a "Put out the garbage" item
        And I complete the "Walk the dog" item
       Then the "Walk the dog" item should be completed

  Scenario: I should see the number of todos decrease when an item is completed
      Given I have an open browser
       When I browse to the application home page
        And I add a "Walk the dog" item
        And I add a "Put out the garbage" item
        And I complete the "Put out the garbage" item
       Then the number of items left should contain "1"
     
  Scenario: I should see that there are zero items todo when all are toggled complete
      Given I have an open browser
       When I browse to the application home page
        And I add a "Walk the dog" item
        And I add a "Put out the garbage" item
        And I toggle all items
       Then the number of items left should contain "0"
     
  Scenario: I should see how many items todo when all are toggled to incomplete
      Given I have an open browser
       When I browse to the application home page
        And I add a "Walk the dog" item
        And I add a "Put out the garbage" item
        And I toggle all items
        And I toggle all items
       Then the number of items left should contain "2"
