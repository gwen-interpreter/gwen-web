@StepDef
Scenario: I browse to the application home page
    Given I navigate to "http://todomvc.com/examples/${js-framework}"
     Then the heading can be located by tag name "h1"
      And the info panel can be located by ${locator-info} "info"
      And the todo field can be located by ${locator-todo} "new-todo"
      And the placeholder string is defined by javascript "document.${locator-placeholder-js}.getAttribute('placeholder')"
      And the number of items left can be located by javascript "${locator-todo-count-js}"
      And the toggle all checkbox can be located by ${locator-toggle-all} "toggle-all"
      And the clear completed button can be located by ${locator-clear-completed} "clear-completed"
      And the displayed items is defined by javascript "[].map.call([].filter.call(${locator-todo-list-items}, function(node) {return node.offsetParent !== null;}), function(node){return node.textContent.trim() || node.innerText.trim() || ''; }).join(',');"
      And I wait for the todo field

@StepDef

      Then the number of items left should not be displayed

@StepDef
Scenario: I add a "<todo>" item
      When I enter "$<todo>" in the todo field
      Then the "$<todo>" item can be located by xpath "${xpath-todo-list}//input[@type='checkbox']/following-sibling::label[contains(.,'$<todo>')]"
       And the "$<todo>" item checkbox can be located by xpath "${xpath-todo-list}//input[@type='checkbox']/following-sibling::label[contains(.,'$<todo>')]/preceding-sibling::input"

@StepDef
Scenario: I complete the "<todo>" item
    Given I click the "$<todo>" item checkbox
     
@StepDef
Scenario: the "<todo>" item should be completed
    Given the "$<todo>" item checkbox should be checked
     
@StepDef
Scenario: the "<todo>" item should be active
    Given the "$<todo>" item checkbox should not be checked
    
@StepDef
Scenario: I delete the "<todo>" item
    Given the delete button can be located by xpath "${xpath-todo-list}//input[@type='checkbox']/following-sibling::label[contains(.,'$<todo>')]/following-sibling::button"
      And I click the delete button of the "$<todo>" item  

@StepDef
Scenario: the clear completed items option should be unavailable
    Given the clear completed button should not be displayed

Scenario: I apply the "<filter>" filter
    Given the filter can be located by link text "$<filter>" 
     When I click the filter
     Then the "$<filter>" filter is selected is defined by javascript "document.querySelector('.selected').textContent == '$<filter>'"
     
@StepDef
Scenario: the "<filter>" filter should be selected
    Given the "$<filter>" filter is selected should be "true"
