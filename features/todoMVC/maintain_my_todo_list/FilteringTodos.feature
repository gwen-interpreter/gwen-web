   Feature: Filtering todos
  
Background: Open a new browser
      Given I have no open browser
       When I start a browser for James
       Then I should have 1 open browser
      
  Scenario: I should be able to view only completed todos
      Given I have an open browser
       When I browse to the application home page
        And I add a "Walk the dog" item
        And I add a "Put out the garbage" item
        And I complete the "Walk the dog" item
        And I apply the "Completed" filter
       Then the displayed items should be "Walk the dog"
        And the "Completed" filter should be selected
        
  Scenario: I should be able to view only incomplete todos
      Given I have an open browser
       When I browse to the application home page
        And I add a "Walk the dog" item
        And I add a "Put out the garbage" item
        And I complete the "Walk the dog" item
        And I apply the "Active" filter
       Then the displayed items should be "Put out the garbage"
        And the "Active" filter should be selected
        
  Scenario: I should be able to view both complete and incomplete todos
      Given I have an open browser
       When I browse to the application home page
        And I add a "Walk the dog" item
        And I add a "Put out the garbage" item
        And I complete the "Walk the dog" item
        And I apply the "Active" filter
        And I apply the "All" filter
       Then the displayed items should be "Walk the dog,Put out the garbage"
        And the "All" filter should be selected
