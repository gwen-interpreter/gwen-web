 Feature: Strings rules Meta

  @StepDef
  @Action
  Scenario: I join the two strings
      Given the result is "${string 1}${string 2}"

  @StepDef
  @Action
  Scenario Template: I join two strings in meta

      Given string 1 is "<string 1>"
        And string 2 is "<string 2>"
       When I join the two strings
       Then the result should be "<result>"

  Examples:

            The header row contains the placeholder names. The body rows that
            follow contain the data that is bound to each scenario that is evaluated.

            | string 1 | string 2 | result   |
            | howdy    | doo      | howdydoo |
            | any      | thing    | anything |

  @StepDef
  @Action
  Scenario: I substitute string 1 for string 2 in string 3
      Given the result is defined by javascript "'${string 3}'.replace('${string 1}', '${string 2}')"
