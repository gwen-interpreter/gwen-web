 @Context
 @StepDef
 Scenario: a new todo list
      When I navigate to "http://todomvc.com/examples/react"
      Then the todo field can be located by class "new-todo"
       And count can be located by css ".todo-count strong"

 @Action
 @StepDef
 @ForEach
 @DataTable(horizontal="item")
 Scenario: the following items are added
      When I enter data[item] in the todo field
      Then count should be record.number

 @Assertion
 @StepDef
 Scenario: the list will contain <expected> items
      Then count should be "$<expected>"
